These pieces are designed with very tight tolerances and material shrinkage can vary. It is very likely that you will find that the top and bottom halves of the mount slide together much more snugly than desired. While it's possible to scale down the top piece of the bracket, I personally found it more reliable to print at the provided size and then do light sanding on the top piece as-needed.

Also, note that the dovetail joint will loosen very slightly over time, so take care not to remove too much material. 

The TPU Band fit should be snug, but not so tight that removing it risks breaking the band.

It is recommended not to run the rover without the bands in place, as this can cause mounted parts to loosen over time due to vibration, potentially resulting in damage to the sensor unit.

An optional TPU vibrationd dampener is also provided and can be placed between the mount's base and the top chassis, should you want to mount particularly sensetive parts.
